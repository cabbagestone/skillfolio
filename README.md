A catch-all location for storing the work that I do as I aspire to become a software architect

## Beginner Decisions:
- programming language
  - Typescript
- object oriented development
  - Self reporting survey
- a development platform
  - Web development
- picking your IDE of choice
  - Neovim/Code
- understanding of databases
  - Measuring understanding of databases?
- troubleshooting process
  - Create a basic troubleshooting process
- basic problem solving strategies
  - Create a basic problem solving strategy handling mechanism.

Beginner Developer project:
- in typescript
- using object oriented programming
- writing it in neovim
- using a database
- documenting the code troubleshooting
- documenting the problem solving
- include basic algorithms
- use git for the project
- some sort of representation of the computer hardware components.
- Single development platform: Web development

ideas: using typescript to create a hardware emulator for the web. somehow. lol. maybe a little web app explaining hardware? maybe deploy the app and have a leaderboard?
maybe some sort of calculator? I wonder if it could be something that I could use personally.

Probably use angular, just because that's something it's important to include in your portfolio
